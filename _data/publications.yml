  title: "Nested, but Separate: Isolating Unrelated Critical Sections in Real-Time Nested Locking"
  time: 2020
  file: technical_writing/ecrts2020_extended.pdf
  details: "Björn Brandenburg and I introduced a novel real-time fined-grained nested locking protocol for real-time systems under clustered scheduling. Our protocol provides temporal isolation for latency-sensitive tasks that access (possibly) nested resources while remaining asymptotically optimal. The paper has been published in the proceedings of the 32nd Euromicro Conference on Real-Time Systems. The extended version is available for download at the following link."

  title: Bachelor's Thesis - Identifying Combinatorial Structures for Binary Strings and Set Partitions
  time: 2018
  file: technical_writing/Identifying_Structures_of_Combintorial_Objects.pdf
  details: "Sigurður Helgason and I explore how to build combinatorial specifications for avoidance classes of binary strings and set partitions in our bachelor's thesis. We build upon the work of Bean et al. and the CombSpecSearcher system to do so. We show that we can find a combinatorial specification for any avoidance class of binary strings, and combinatorial specifications for many avoidance classes of set partitions."

  title: Optical Character Recognition of Cyrillic Characters Using a Convolutional Neural Network
  time: 2017
  file: technical_writing/dragnet.pdf
  details: 'I created a convolutional neural network and a set of complementary utilities for optical character recognition with two classmates in my Introduction to Artificial Intelligence course at Reykjavik University. In particular, we focused on reconstructing water damaged documents written in the Ukrainian language. Tensorflow was used for the neural network and the <a href="https://github.com/jamesrobb/dragnet">code is published on GitHub</a>.'

  title: Embedded Device Hacking - ASUS RT-AC68U
  time: 2017 
  external_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhj10h0A378
  details: 'In my Computer Security class I explored embedded device hacking with the ASUS RT-AC68U router. First I outline how we can examine the firmware of the router and execute some commands in an emulated environment. I then review an exploit that allows a client connected to the router to gain root access. Finally, I demonstrate an exploit that allows a client to obtain persistent ssh access to the router.'
